- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Jansen van Vuuren.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in becoming a Front-end Web Developer.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- I've only just started out and I'm  not even really sure where to start and what to do. I'm sure I'll be updating this more as I understand more.
